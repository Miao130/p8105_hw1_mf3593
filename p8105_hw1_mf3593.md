``` r

ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x=time_hour,y=temp,color=humid))+geom_point()
```

    ## Saving 7 x 5 in image

the dataset contains weather information for EWR in January of the year
2013. It has variables origin, year, month, day, hour, temp, dewp,
humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, precip, pressure, visib,
time_hour. It records temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed,
wind_gust, precip, pressure, visib every hour on every day for fifteen
days in January 2013. The size of the dataset is 358 rows 15 columns.
The mean temperature is 39.5821229

According to the scatterplot of this dataset, we can see the temperature
fluctuates a lot within one day but overall increased from Jan 01 to Jan
15. The humidity also in general increased over the 15 days.

\#Problem 2

``` r
df=tibble(
  x=rnorm(10),
  log_vec=x>0,
  cha_vec=c("A","B","C","D","E","F","G","H","I","J"),
  fac_vec=factor(c("Low","Medium","Medium","High","Low","Medium","High","High","Low","High"))
)
mean_x=mean(pull(df,x))
mean_log=mean(pull(df,log_vec))
mean_cha=mean(pull(df,cha_vec))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df, cha_vec)): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

``` r
mean_fac=mean(pull(df,fac_vec))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df, fac_vec)): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

when calculating mean, mean function works for x and mean_log, but
mean_cha and mean_fac return NA and a warning message shows argument is
not numeric or logical: returning NA.

when apply as.numeric, the factor vector is converted to numeric vector.
The logical vector can be converted based on 1 corresponds to TRUE and 0
corresponds to FALSE. The factor vector can be converted to numeric
factor where numeric codes corresponding to the factor levels are
returned. Character vector is converted only when the original content
is a number but in character format. In this case, since it was letters,
it was not converted to numeric vector. This explains why we couldn’t
get mean of factor and character vectors before. We need to convert them
to numeric values.
